"\"Virtual hosting\" is, loosely, the act of serving a :app:`Pyramid` "

":app:`Pyramid` provides facilities for serving an application under a URL"

":app:`Pyramid` supports a common form of virtual hosting whereby you can "
"host a :app:`Pyramid` application as a \"subset\" of some other site "

"under ``http://example.com/``)."

"If you use a \"pure Python\" environment, this functionality can be "
"provided by `rutter <http://rutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, forming "
"a \"composite\" WSGI application.  Alternatively, you can use "
":term:`mod_wsgi` to serve your application, which handles this virtual "
"hosting translation for you \"under the hood\"."

"If you use the ``rutter`` composite application \"in front\" of a "
":app:`Pyramid` application or if you use :term:`mod_wsgi` to serve up a "
":app:`Pyramid` application, nothing special needs to be done within the "
"application for URLs to be generated that contain a prefix. Rutter and "
":term:`mod_wsgi` manipulate the :term:`WSGI` environment in such a way "

" directive to pass the original ``HTTP_HOST`` header along to the "
"application, so URLs get generated properly.  As of this writing the "

"Virtual root support is useful when you'd like to host some resource in a"
" :app:`Pyramid` resource tree as an application under a URL pathname that"
" does not include the resource path itself.  For example, you might want "
"to serve the object at the traversal path ``/cms`` as an application "
"reachable via ``http://example.com/`` (as opposed to "
"``http://example.com/cms``)."

"To specify a virtual root, cause an environment variable to be inserted "
"into the WSGI environ named ``HTTP_X_VHM_ROOT`` with a value that is the "
"absolute pathname to the resource object in the resource tree that should"
" behave as the \"root\" resource.  As a result, the traversal machinery "
"will respect this value during traversal (prepending it to the PATH_INFO "
"before traversal starts), and the "
":meth:`pyramid.request.Request.resource_url` API will generate the "
"\"correct\" virtually-rooted URLs."
