"This article explains the new features in :app:`Pyramid` version 1.8 as "
"compared to its predecessor, :app:`Pyramid` 1.7. It also documents "
"backwards incompatibilities between the two versions and deprecations "
"added to :app:`Pyramid` 1.8, as well as software dependency changes and "
"notable documentation additions."

"Added :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_exception_view` and the "
":func:`pyramid.view.exception_view_config` decorator. It is now possible "
"using these methods or via the new ``exception_only=True`` option to "
":meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view` to add a view which will "
"only be matched when handling an exception. Previously, any exception "
"views were also registered for a traversal context that inherited from "
"the exception class which prevented any exception-only optimizations. See"

"Added the ``exception_only`` boolean to "

"Change static view to avoid setting the ``Content-Encoding`` response "
