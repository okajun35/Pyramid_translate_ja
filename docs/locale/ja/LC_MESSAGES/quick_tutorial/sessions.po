"Pyramid has basic built-in support for sessions.  Third party packages "
"such as `pyramid_redis_sessions "
"<https://github.com/ericrasmussen/pyramid_redis_sessions>`_ provide "
"richer session support. Or you can create your own custom sessioning "
"engine. Let's take a look at the :doc:`built-in sessioning support "

"can't just return it in the web response for the POST, as it will be "
