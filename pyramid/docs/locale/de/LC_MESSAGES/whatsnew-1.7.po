msgid ""
"A new :ref:`view_derivers` concept has been added to Pyramid to allow "
"framework authors to inject elements into the standard Pyramid view "
"pipeline and affect all views in an application. This is similar to a "
"decorator except that it has access to options passed to "
"``config.add_view`` and can affect other stages of the pipeline such as "
"the raw response from a view or prior to security checks. See "
"https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2021"

"Added a ``require_csrf`` view option which will enforce CSRF checks on "
"requests with an unsafe method as defined by RFC2616. If the CSRF check "
"fails a ``BadCSRFToken`` exception will be raised and may be caught by "
"exception views (the default response is a ``400 Bad Request``). This "
"option should be used in place of the deprecated ``check_csrf`` view "
"predicate which would normally result in unexpected ``404 Not Found`` "
"response to the client instead of a catchable exception.  See "

"Added a new method, "
":meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.set_csrf_default_options`, for "
"configuring CSRF checks used by the ``require_csrf=True`` view option. "
"This method can be used to turn on CSRF checks globally for every view in"
" the application. This should be considered a good default for websites "
"built on Pyramid. It is possible to opt-out of CSRF checks on a per-view "
"basis by setting ``require_csrf=False`` on those views. See "

"Added an additional CSRF validation that checks the origin/referrer of a "
"request and makes sure it matches the current ``request.domain``. This "
"particular check is only active when accessing a site over HTTPS as "
"otherwise browsers don't always send the required information. If this "
"additional CSRF validation fails a ``BadCSRFOrigin`` exception will be "
"raised and may be caught by exception views (the default response is "
"``400 Bad Request``). Additional allowed origins may be configured by "
"setting ``pyramid.csrf_trusted_origins`` to a list of domain names (with "
"ports if on a non standard port) to allow. Subdomains are not allowed "
"unless the domain name has been prefixed with a ``.``. See "
