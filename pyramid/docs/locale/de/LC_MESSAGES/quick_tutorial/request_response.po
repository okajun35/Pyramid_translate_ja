"Developing for the web means processing web requests. As this is a "

"Pyramid has always fit nicely into the existing world of Python web "
"development (virtual environments, packaging, cookiecutters, first to "
"embrace Python 3, and so on). Pyramid turned to the well-regarded "
":term:`WebOb` Python library for request and response handling. In our "
"example above, Pyramid hands ``hello_world`` a ``request`` that is "
":ref:`based on WebOb <webob_chapter>`."
