"This \"Getting Started\" tutorial is broken into independent steps, "
"starting with the smallest possible \"single file WSGI app\" example. "
"Each of these steps introduces a topic and a very small set of concepts "
"via working code. The steps each correspond to a directory in our "
"workspace, where each step's directory is a Python package. Source code "
"used in this tutorial is located in the `Pyramid repository in the "
"directory \"docs/quick_tutorial\" <https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/>`_."
" You may ``git clone`` the repository, download, or copy-paste the source"
" code. If you do so, then make sure you use the same branch as this "
"documentation."
