"There is nothing special about the filename ``user.py`` or ``page.py`` "
"except that they are Python modules.  A project may have many models "
"throughout its codebase in arbitrarily named modules.  Modules "
"implementing models often have ``model`` in their names or they may live "
"in a Python subpackage of your application package named ``models`` (as "
"we've done in this tutorial), but this is only a convention and not a "

":class:`sqlalchemy.schema.Column`). These will map to columns in the "
"``users`` table. The ``id`` attribute will be the primary key in the "
"table. The ``name`` attribute will be a text column, each value of which "

"There are two helper methods that will help us later when using the user "

"process known as \"hashing\". The second method, ``check_password``, will"
" allow us to compare the hashed value of the submitted password against "
"the hashed value of the password stored in the user's record in the "

"foreign key referencing the ``users`` table. Foreign keys are very useful"
" at the schema-level, but since we want to relate ``User`` objects with "
"``Page`` objects, we also define a ``creator`` attribute as an ORM-level "
"mapping between the two tables. SQLAlchemy will automatically populate "
"this value using the foreign key referencing the user. Since the foreign "
