"A :term:`template` is a file on disk which can be used to render dynamic "
"data provided by a :term:`view`.  :app:`Pyramid` offers a number of ways "
"to perform templating tasks out of the box, and provides add-on "
"templating support through a set of bindings packages."

"Before discussing how built-in templates are used in detail, we'll "
"discuss two ways to render templates within :app:`Pyramid` in general: "
"directly and via renderer configuration."

msgid "Using Templates Directly"
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/templates.rst:23
msgid ""
"The most straightforward way to use a template within :app:`Pyramid` is "
"to cause it to be rendered directly within a :term:`view callable`.  You "
"may use whatever API is supplied by a given templating engine to do so."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/templates.rst:27
msgid ""
":app:`Pyramid` provides various APIs that allow you to render templates "
"directly from within a view callable.  For example, if there is a "
":term:`Chameleon` ZPT template named ``foo.pt`` in a directory named "
"``templates`` in your application, you can render the template from "
"within the body of a view callable like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/templates.rst:43
msgid ""
"The ``sample_view`` :term:`view callable` function above returns a "
":term:`response` object which contains the body of the "
"``templates/foo.pt`` template.  In this case, the ``templates`` directory"
" should live in the same directory as the module containing the "
"``sample_view`` function.  The template author will have the names "
"``foo`` and ``bar`` available as top-level names for replacement or "
"comparison purposes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/templates.rst:50
msgid ""
"In the example above, the path ``templates/foo.pt`` is relative to the "
"directory containing the file which defines the view configuration. In "
"this case, this is the directory containing the file that defines the "
"``sample_view`` function.  Although a renderer path is usually just a "
"simple relative pathname, a path named as a renderer can be absolute, "
"starting with a slash on UNIX or a drive letter prefix on Windows. The "
"path can alternatively be an :term:`asset specification` in the form "
"``some.dotted.package_name:relative/path``. This makes it possible to "
"address template assets which live in another package.  For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/templates.rst:70
msgid ""
"An asset specification points at a file within a Python *package*. In "
"this case, it points at a file named ``foo.pt`` within the ``templates`` "
"directory of the ``mypackage`` package.  Using an asset specification "
"instead of a relative template name is usually a good idea, because calls"
" to :func:`~pyramid.renderers.render_to_response` using asset "
"specifications will continue to work properly if you move the code "
"containing them to another location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/templates.rst:78
msgid ""
"In the examples above we pass in a keyword argument named ``request`` "
"representing the current :app:`Pyramid` request. Passing a request "
"keyword argument will cause the ``render_to_response`` function to supply"
" the renderer with more correct system values (see "
":ref:`renderer_system_values`), because most of the information required "
"to compose proper system values is present in the request.  If your "
"template relies on the name ``request`` or ``context``, or if you've "
"configured special :term:`renderer globals`, make sure to pass "
"``request`` as a keyword argument in every call to a "
"``pyramid.renderers.render_*`` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/templates.rst:88
msgid ""
"Every view must return a :term:`response` object, except for views which "
"use a :term:`renderer` named via view configuration (which we'll see "
"shortly).  The :func:`pyramid.renderers.render_to_response` function is a"
" shortcut function that actually returns a response object. This allows "
"the example view above to simply return the result of its call to "
"``render_to_response()`` directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/templates.rst:94
msgid ""
"Obviously not all APIs you might call to get response data will return a "
"response object. For example, you might render one or more templates to a"
" string that you want to use as response data.  The "
":func:`pyramid.renderers.render` API renders a template to a string. We "
"can manufacture a :term:`response` object directly, and use that string "
"as the body of the response:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/templates.rst:114
msgid ""
"Because :term:`view callable` functions are typically the only code in "
":app:`Pyramid` that need to know anything about templates, and because "
"view functions are very simple Python, you can use whatever templating "
"system with which you're most comfortable within :app:`Pyramid`.  Install"
" the templating system, import its API functions into your views module, "
"use those APIs to generate a string, then return that string as the body "
"of a :app:`Pyramid` :term:`Response` object."

":app:`Pyramid` :term:`view`:"

"You probably wouldn't use this particular snippet in a project, because "
"it's easier to use the supported :ref:`Mako bindings "
"<available_template_system_bindings>`. But if your favorite templating "
"system is not supported as a renderer extension for :app:`Pyramid`, you "
"can create your own simple combination as shown above."

"If you use third-party templating languages without cooperating "
":app:`Pyramid` bindings directly within view callables, the auto-"
"template-reload strategy explained in :ref:`reload_templates_section` "
"will not be available, nor will the template asset overriding capability "
"explained in :ref:`overriding_assets_section` be available, nor will it "
"be possible to use any template using that language as a "
":term:`renderer`. However, it's reasonably easy to write custom "
"templating system binding packages for use under :app:`Pyramid` so that "
"templates written in the language can be used as renderers. See "

":term:`Response` object.  Making testing assertions about response "
"objects is typically an indirect process, because it means that your test"
" code often needs to somehow parse information out of the response body "
"(often HTML). View callables configured with renderers externally via "
