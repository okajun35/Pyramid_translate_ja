"Under the hood, :app:`Pyramid` uses a :term:`Zope Component Architecture`"

"The ``zope.component`` API used to access data in a traditional Zope "
"application can be opaque.  For example, here is a typical \"unnamed "
"utility\" lookup using the :func:`zope.component.getUtility` global API "
"as it might appear in a traditional Zope application:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After this code runs, ``settings`` will be a Python dictionary.  But it's"
" unlikely that any \"civilian\" will be able to figure this out just by "
"reading the code casually.  When the ``zope.component.getUtility`` API is"
" used by a developer, the conceptual load on a casual reader of code is "
"high."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/zca.rst:35
msgid ""
"While the ZCA is an excellent tool with which to build a *framework* such"
" as :app:`Pyramid`, it is not always the best tool with which to build an"
" *application* due to the opacity of the ``zope.component`` APIs.  "
"Accordingly, :app:`Pyramid` tends to hide the presence of the ZCA from "
"application developers.  You needn't understand the ZCA to create a "
":app:`Pyramid` application; its use is effectively only a framework "
"implementation detail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/zca.rst:42

"However, developers who are already used to writing :term:`Zope` "
"applications often still wish to use the ZCA while building a "

":term:`Zope` uses a single ZCA registry—the \"global\" ZCA registry—for "
"all Zope applications that run in the same Python process, effectively "
"making it impossible to run more than one Zope application in a single "
"process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/zca.rst:59
msgid ""
"However, for ease of deployment, it's often useful to be able to run more"
" than a single application per process.  For example, use of a "
":term:`PasteDeploy` \"composite\" allows you to run separate individual "
"WSGI applications in the same process, each answering requests for some "
"URL prefix.  This makes it possible to run, for example, a TurboGears "
"application at ``/turbogears`` and a :app:`Pyramid` application at "
"``/pyramid``, both served up using the same :term:`WSGI` server within a "
"single Python process."

"Most production Zope applications are relatively large, making it "
"impractical due to memory constraints to run more than one Zope "
"application per Python process.  However, a :app:`Pyramid` application "
"may be very small and consume very little memory, so it's a reasonable "
"goal to be able to run more than one :app:`Pyramid` application per "
"process."

"In order to make it possible to run more than one :app:`Pyramid` "

"While this services a reasonable goal, it causes some issues when trying "
"to use patterns which you might use to build a typical :term:`Zope` "
"application to build a :app:`Pyramid` application.  Without special help,"
" ZCA \"global\" APIs such as :func:`zope.component.getUtility` and "
":func:`zope.component.getSiteManager` will use the ZCA \"global\" "
"registry. Therefore, these APIs will appear to fail when used in a "
":app:`Pyramid` application, because they'll be consulting the ZCA global "
"registry rather than the component registry associated with your "
":app:`Pyramid` application."

#: ../../narr/zca.rst:86
msgid ""
"There are three ways to fix this: by disusing the ZCA global API "
"entirely, by using :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.hook_zca` or by "
"passing the ZCA global registry to the :term:`Configurator` constructor "

"ZCA \"global\" API functions such as ``zope.component.getSiteManager``, "
"``zope.component.getUtility``, :func:`zope.component.getAdapter`, and "
":func:`zope.component.getMultiAdapter` aren't strictly necessary.  Every "
"component registry has a method API that offers the same functionality; "
"it can be used instead.  For example, presuming the ``registry`` value "
"below is a Zope Component Architecture component registry, the following "
"bit of code is equivalent to ``zope.component.getUtility(IFoo)``:"

#: ../../narr/zca.rst:120
msgid ""
"use the :func:`pyramid.threadlocal.get_current_registry` function within "

#: ../../narr/zca.rst:151
msgid ""
"When the ``app`` function above is run, a :term:`Configurator` is "
"constructed. When the configurator is created, it creates a *new* "
":term:`application registry` (a ZCA component registry).  A new registry "

"Calling ``hook_zca`` is usually sufficient to \"fix\" the problem of "

"  However, it also means that a Zope application that is running in the "
"same process may start using the :app:`Pyramid` global registry instead "
