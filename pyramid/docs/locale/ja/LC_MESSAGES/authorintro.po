"Welcome to \"The :app:`Pyramid` Web Framework\".  In this introduction, "
"I'll describe the audience for this book, I'll describe the book content,"
" I'll provide some context regarding the genesis of :app:`Pyramid`, and "
"I'll thank some important people."

"This book is aimed primarily at a reader that has the following "
"attributes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../authorintro.rst:22
msgid "At least a moderate amount of :term:`Python` experience."
msgstr ""

#: ../../authorintro.rst:24
msgid "A familiarity with web protocols such as HTTP and CGI."

"If you fit into both of these categories, you're in the direct target "

"Python is an *excellent* language in which to write applications; "
"becoming productive in Python is almost mind-blowingly easy.  If you "
"already have experience in another language such as Java, Visual Basic, "
"Perl, Ruby, or even C/C++, learning Python will be a snap; it should take"
" you no longer than a couple of days to become modestly productive.  If "
"you don't have previous programming experience, it will be slightly "
"harder, and it will take a little longer, but you'd be hard-pressed to "
"find a better \"first language.\""

"Web technology familiarity is assumed in various places within the book."
"  For example, the book doesn't try to define common web-related concepts"
" like \"URL\" or \"query string.\"  Likewise, the book describes various "
"interactions in terms of the HTTP protocol, but it does not describe how "
"the HTTP protocol works in detail.  Like any good web framework, though, "
":app:`Pyramid` shields you from needing to know most of the gory details "
"of web protocols and low-level data structures. As a result, you can "
"usually avoid becoming \"blocked\" while you read this book even if you "
"don't yet deeply understand web technologies."

"if you read them out-of-order, or when you need only a reminder about a "

msgid "Before the end of 2010, :app:`Pyramid` was known as :mod:`repoze.bfg`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../authorintro.rst:98
msgid ""
"I wrote :mod:`repoze.bfg` after many years of writing applications using "
":term:`Zope`.  Zope provided me with a lot of mileage: it wasn't until "
"almost a decade of successfully creating applications using it that I "
"decided to write a different web framework.  Although :mod:`repoze.bfg` "
"takes inspiration from a variety of web frameworks, it owes more of its "
"core design to Zope than any other."
msgstr ""

#: ../../authorintro.rst:105
msgid ""
"The Repoze \"brand\" existed before :mod:`repoze.bfg` was created.  One "
"of the first packages developed as part of the Repoze brand was a package"
" named :mod:`repoze.zope2`.  This was a package that allowed Zope 2 "
"applications to run under a :term:`WSGI` server without modification.  "
"Zope 2 did not have reasonable WSGI support at the time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../authorintro.rst:112
msgid ""
"During the development of the :mod:`repoze.zope2` package, I found that "
"replicating the Zope 2 \"publisher\" -- the machinery that maps URLs to "
"code -- was time-consuming and fiddly.  Zope 2 had evolved over many "
"years, and emulating all of its edge cases was extremely difficult.  I "
"finished the :mod:`repoze.zope2` package, and it emulates the normal Zope"
" 2 publisher pretty well.  But during its development, it became clear "
"that Zope 2 had simply begun to exceed my tolerance for complexity, and I"
" began to look around for simpler options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../authorintro.rst:122
msgid ""
"I considered using the Zope 3 application server machinery, but it turned"
" out that it had become more indirect than the Zope 2 machinery it aimed "
"to replace, which didn't fulfill the goal of simplification. I also "
"considered using Django and Pylons, but neither of those frameworks offer"
" much along the axes of traversal, contextual declarative security, or "
"application extensibility; these were features I had become accustomed to"
" as a Zope developer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../authorintro.rst:130
msgid ""
"I decided that in the long term, creating a simpler framework that "
"retained features I had become accustomed to when developing Zope "
"applications was a more reasonable idea than continuing to use any Zope "
"publisher or living with the limitations and unfamiliarities of a "
"different framework.  The result is what is now :app:`Pyramid`."

msgid ""
"What was :mod:`repoze.bfg` has become :app:`Pyramid` as the result of a "
"coalition built between the :term:`Repoze` and :term:`Pylons` community "
"throughout the year 2010.  By merging technology, we're able to reduce "
"duplication of effort, and take advantage of more of each others' "
"technology."
