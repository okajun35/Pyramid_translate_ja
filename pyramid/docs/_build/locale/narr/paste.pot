msgid "Packages generated via a :term:`cookiecutter` make use of a system created by Ian Bicking named :term:`PasteDeploy`.  PasteDeploy defines a way to declare :term:`WSGI` application configuration in an ``.ini`` file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/paste.rst:10
msgid "Pyramid uses this configuration file format as input to its :term:`WSGI` server runner ``pserve``, as well as other commands such as ``pviews``, ``pshell``, ``proutes``, and ``ptweens``."

msgid "PasteDeploy is not a particularly integral part of Pyramid.  It's possible to create a Pyramid application which does not use PasteDeploy at all.  We show a Pyramid application that doesn't use PasteDeploy in :ref:`firstapp_chapter`. However, all Pyramid cookiecutters render PasteDeploy configuration files, to provide new developers with a standardized way of setting deployment values, and to provide new users with a standardized way of starting, stopping, and debugging an application."

msgid ":term:`plaster` is the system that Pyramid uses to load settings from configuration files. The most common format for these files is an ``.ini`` format structured in a way defined by :term:`PasteDeploy`.  The format supports mechanisms to define WSGI app :term:`deployment settings`, WSGI server settings and logging. This allows the ``pserve`` command to work, allowing you to stop and start a Pyramid application easily."

msgid "In the :ref:`project_narr` chapter, we breezed over the meaning of a configuration line in the ``deployment.ini`` file.  This was the ``use = egg:myproject`` line in the ``[app:main]`` section.  We breezed over it because it's pretty confusing and \"too much information\" for an introduction to the system.  We'll try to give it a bit of attention here.  Let's see the config file again:"

#: ../../narr/paste.rst:47
msgid "The line in ``[app:main]`` above that says ``use = egg:myproject`` is actually shorthand for a longer spelling: ``use = egg:myproject#main``.  The ``#main`` part is omitted for brevity, as ``#main`` is a default defined by PasteDeploy. ``egg:myproject#main`` is a string which has meaning to PasteDeploy.  It points at a :term:`setuptools` :term:`entry point` named ``main`` defined in the ``myproject`` project."

msgid "Take a look at the generated ``setup.py`` file for this project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/paste.rst:60
msgid "Note that ``entry_points`` is assigned a string which looks a lot like an ``.ini`` file.  This string representation of an ``.ini`` file has a section named ``[paste.app_factory]``.  Within this section, there is a key named ``main`` (the entry point name) which has a value ``myproject:main``.  The *key* ``main`` is what our ``egg:myproject#main`` value of the ``use`` section in our config file is pointing at, although it is actually shortened to ``egg:myproject`` there.  The value represents a :term:`dotted Python name` path, which refers to a callable in our ``myproject`` package's ``__init__.py`` module."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/paste.rst:70
msgid "The ``egg:`` prefix in ``egg:myproject`` indicates that this is an entry point *URI* specifier, where the \"scheme\" is \"egg\".  An \"egg\" is created when you run ``setup.py install`` or ``setup.py develop`` within your project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/paste.rst:74
msgid "In English, this entry point can thus be referred to as a \"PasteDeploy application factory in the ``myproject`` project which has the entry point named ``main`` where the entry point refers to a ``main`` function in the ``mypackage`` module\".  Indeed, if you open up the ``__init__.py`` module generated within any cookiecutter-generated package, you'll see a ``main`` function.  This is the function called by :term:`PasteDeploy` when the ``pserve`` command is invoked against our application.  It accepts a global configuration object and *returns* an instance of our application."

msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/paste.rst:88
msgid "You can add a ``[DEFAULT]`` section to your PasteDeploy ``.ini`` file.  Such a section should consist of global parameters that are shared by all the applications, servers, and :term:`middleware` defined within the configuration file.  The values in a ``[DEFAULT]`` section will be passed to your application's ``main`` function as ``global_config`` (see the reference to the ``main`` function in :ref:`init_py`)."

msgid "Alternative Configuration File Formats"
msgstr ""

#: ../../narr/paste.rst:98
msgid "It is possible to use different file formats with :app:`Pyramid` if you do not like :term:`PasteDeploy`. Under the hood all command-line scripts such as ``pserve`` and ``pshell`` pass the ``config_uri`` (e.g. ``development.ini`` or ``production.ini``) to the :term:`plaster` library which performs a lookup for an appropriate parser. For ``.ini`` files it uses PasteDeploy but you can register your own configuration formats that plaster will find instead."
