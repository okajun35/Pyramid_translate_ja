msgid "We will now add tests for the models and views as well as a few functional tests in a new ``tests`` subpackage.  Tests ensure that an application works, and that it continues to work when changes are made in the future."

msgid "The file ``tests.py`` was generated as part of the ``alchemy`` cookiecutter, but it is a common practice to put tests into a ``tests`` subpackage, especially as projects grow in size and complexity.  Each module in the test subpackage should contain tests for its corresponding module in our application.  Each corresponding pair of modules should have the same names, except the test module should have the prefix ``test_``."

msgid "It is very important when refactoring a Python module into a package to be sure to delete the cache files (``.pyc`` files or ``__pycache__`` folders) sitting around! Python will prioritize the cache files before traversing into folders, using the old code, and you will wonder why none of your changes are working!"

msgid "We'll create a new ``tests/test_views.py`` file, adding a ``BaseTest`` class used as the base for other test classes. Next we'll add tests for each view function we previously added to our application. We'll add four test classes: ``ViewWikiTests``, ``ViewPageTests``, ``AddPageTests``, and ``EditPageTests``. These test the ``view_wiki``, ``view_page``, ``add_page``, and ``edit_page`` views."
