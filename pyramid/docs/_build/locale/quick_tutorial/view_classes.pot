msgid "So far our views have been simple, free-standing functions. Many times your views are related to one another. They may consist of different ways to look at or work on the same data, or be a REST API that handles multiple operations. Grouping these views together as a :ref:`view class <class_as_view>` makes sense:"

msgid "In our ``TutorialViews`` view class, you can see that our two view classes are logically grouped together as methods on a common class. Since the two views shared the same template, we could move that to a ``@view_defaults`` decorator at the class level."

#: ../../quick_tutorial/view_classes.rst:90
msgid "The tests needed to change. Obviously we needed to import the view class. But you can also see the pattern in the tests of instantiating the view class with the dummy request first, then calling the view method being tested."
