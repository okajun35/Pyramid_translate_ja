msgid "To ease the process of getting started on a project, the Pylons Project provides :term:`cookiecutter`\\ s that generate sample :app:`Pyramid` projects from project templates. These cookiecutters will install :app:`Pyramid` and its dependencies as well. We will still cover many topics of web application development using :app:`Pyramid`, but it's good to know of this facility. This prelude will demonstrate how to get a working :app:`Pyramid` web application running via ``cookiecutter``."

When you install :app:`Pyramid`, a small command program called ``pserve`` is written to your ``bin`` directory. This program is an executable Python module. It is passed a configuration file (in this case, ``development.ini``)."
