msgid "Unit tests are a common and popular approach to test-driven development (TDD). In web applications, though, the templating and entire apparatus of a web site are important parts of the delivered quality. We'd like a way to test these."

msgid "`WebTest <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/webtest/en/latest/>`_ is a Python package that does functional testing. With WebTest you can write tests which simulate a full HTTP request against a WSGI application, then test the information in the response. For speed purposes, WebTest skips the setup/teardown of an actual HTTP server, providing tests that run fast enough to be part of TDD."

These new tests not only cover our templating, but they didn't dramatically increase the execution time of our tests."
