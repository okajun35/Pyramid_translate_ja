"This guide will outline broad steps that can be used to get a "
":app:`Pyramid` application running under Apache via ``mod_wsgi``.  This "
"particular tutorial was developed under Apple's Mac OS X platform (Snow "
"Leopard, on a 32-bit Mac), but the instructions should be largely the "
"same for all systems, delta specific path information for commands and "
"files."

"deploying a :app:`Pyramid` application on a Windows system using "

"The first argument to :func:`pyramid.paster.get_app` is the project "

"production.  The second is the name of the section within the ``.ini`` "
"file that should be loaded by ``mod_wsgi``.  The assignment to the name "
