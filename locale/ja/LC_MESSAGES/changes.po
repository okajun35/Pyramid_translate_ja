"Change how ``bfg_view`` decorator works when used as a class method "
"decorator.  In 1.1a7, the``scan``directive actually tried to grope every "
"class in scanned package at startup time, calling ``dir`` against each "
"found class, and subsequently invoking ``getattr`` against each thing "
"found by ``dir`` to see if it was a method.  This led to some strange "
"symptoms (e.g. ``AttributeError: object has no attribute __provides__``),"
" and was generally just a bad idea.  Now, instead of groping classes for "
"methods at startup time, we just cause the ``bfg_view`` decorator itself "
"to populate the method's class' ``__dict__`` when it is used as a method "
"decorator.  This also requires a nasty _getframe thing but it's slightly "
"less nasty than the startup time groping behavior.  This is essentially a"
" reversion back to 1.1a6 \"grokking\" behavior plus some special magic "
"for using the ``bfg_view`` decorator as method decorator inside the "
"``bfg_view`` class itself."

"a ZCML ``view`` declaration, or the respective arguments to a "
"``@bfg_view`` decorator.  View predicates can be used to register a view "
"for a more precise set of environment parameters than was previously "
"possible.  For example, you can register two views with the same ``name``"
" with different ``request_param`` attributes.  If the ``request.params`` "
"dict contains 'foo' (request_param=\"foo\"), one view might be called; if"
" it contains 'bar' (request_param=\"bar\"), another view might be called."

" separate view functions for different form submissions.  The other "
"predicates, ``containment`` and ``request_method`` work similarly.  "
"``containment`` is a view predicate that will match only when the "
