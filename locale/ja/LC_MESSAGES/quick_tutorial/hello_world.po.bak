"Microframeworks were all the rage, until the next shiny thing came along."
" \"Microframework\" is a marketing term, not a technical one. They have a"
" low mental overhead: they do so little, the only things you have to "
"worry about are *your things*."

"Pyramid is special because it can act as a single-file module "
"microframework. You can have a single Python file that can be executed "
"directly by Python. But Pyramid also provides facilities to scale to the "
"largest of applications."

"Python has a standard called :term:`WSGI` that defines how Python web "
"applications plug into standard servers, getting passed incoming "
"requests, and returning responses. Most modern Python web frameworks obey"
" an \"MVC\" (model-view-controller) application pattern, where the data "
"in the model has a view that mediates interaction with outside systems."
