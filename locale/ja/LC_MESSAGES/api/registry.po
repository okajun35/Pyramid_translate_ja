"It is used by the framework itself to perform mappings of URLs to view "
"callables, as well as servicing other various framework duties. A "
"registry has its own internal API, but this API is rarely used by Pyramid"
" application developers (it's usually only used by developers of the "
"Pyramid framework and Pyramid addons).  But it has a number of attributes"
" that may be useful to application developers within application code, "
"such as ``settings``, which is a dictionary containing application "
"deployment settings."

"The registry may be used both as an :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IDict` and"
" as a Zope component registry. These two ways of storing configuration "
"are independent. Applications will tend to prefer to store information as"
" key-values whereas addons may prefer to use the component registry to "
"avoid naming conflicts and to provide more complex lookup mechanisms."
